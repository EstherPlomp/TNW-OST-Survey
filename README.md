## Open Science Terminology

### Open Access
**Open Access means that articles are freely available on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts.**

At TU Delft, we already publish [82% of our research Open Access](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/creating-your-publishing-strategy/open-access-publishing). The TU Delft Library has an [Open Publishing Platform](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/open-publishing) and offers an [Open Access Fund](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/open-access-funding) up to 2000 euros for open access publication fees. You can also check the [Journal Browser](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/journal-browser) to see if you could publish Open Access at no additional costs to you beause of deals that Dutch research institutions made with publishers. 

### Open Data
**Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone** ([Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/)).

At Delft, responsibilities regarding Open Data are outlined in the [policies of the TU Delft and the Faculty](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/policies/tu-delft-faculty-policies/). 

There are several ways to receive support with your Open Data questions: 

- [Data Steward](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/support/data-stewardship/contact)
- [Data Champions](https://osc-delft.github.io/initiatives#data-champions)
- Data Managers ([Digital Competence Center](https://www.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=67120&L=1/))

There is also training available via the TU Delft Library ([Research Data Management 101](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/research-data-management-101) & [Open Science MOOC](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/mooc-open-science-sharing-your-research-with-the-world)) and a [Research Data Management Website](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management) with more information. 

### Open Software
**Open-source can be viewed, used, modified, and distributed for any purpose.**

At TU Delft, responsibilities regarding Open Software are laid out in the [TU Delft Research Software Policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4629662).

There are several ways to receive support with your Open Software questions: 
- Data Steward (more general questions)
- [Research Software Engineers](https://www.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=67120&L=1/) (hands-on practical work)

The TU Delft Library offers software trainings ([Carpentries/Code Refinery](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/)). To make things easier, there is a [GitHub](https://github.com/)/[GitLab](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/) integration with data repositories such as [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/about-your-data/getting-started)/[Zenodo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)

### Open Hardware
**Physical objects that are licenced in such a way that said object can be studied, modified, created, and distributed by anyone.**

At TU Delft we have an [Open Hardware Community](https://osc-delft.github.io/initiatives#delft-open-hardware).


### Open Methods
**Open methods are available details of the research methods, such as procedures, protocols, plans, notes and interpretations.**

At TU Delft there are [licenses for electronic lab notebooks](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/manage/electronic-lab-notebook) that may make it easier to make these documents openly available later on. You can share your methods on protocols such as [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/) or via method papers (see for example [PLOS](https://plos.org/open-science/open-methods/)).

### Open Education
**Open Education is a collective term that encompasses educational resources, tools and practices that can be freely used in the digital environment without legal, financial or technical barriers** ([The Turing Way 2022](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/open/education.html)).

At TU Delft this is offered through open textbooks, or via [MOOCs](https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/) (Massive Open Online Course) and [Open Course Ware](https://ocw.tudelft.nl/). 

### Preregistration
**Preregistration is the practise of specifying your research plan in advance of your study and submitting it to a registry** ([Open Science Framework](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg)).

### Registered Report
**A registered report is an article format where the study proposal is peerreviewed before the research is undertaken. After approved by the reviewers, the results will be published as long as the study proposal is followed and deviations are clearly indicated. This article format facilitates the pubcliation of negative results and reduces time wasted on irrelevant study proposals.** 

See the [Open Science Framework](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports) for more information and resources on Registered Reports. 

### Open Peer Review
**Open Peer Review is a peer review model in which aspects of the peer review process are made publicly available, either before or after publication** ([PLOS](https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/)).

### Preprints
**A preprint is a version of a scholarly or scientific paper that precedes formal peer review and publication in a peer-reviewed scholarly or scientific journal. It is usually uploaded by the authors to a public server (such as [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)) where it is available openly.**


### Science communication/Public engagement
**Science communication or engagement is the practice of engaging, informing, educating, and raising awareness of science-related topics.**

### Citizen Science
**The inclusion of members of the public in scientific research.**
