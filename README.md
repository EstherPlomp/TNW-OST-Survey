## Open Science Terminology

### Open Access
**definition**

At TU Delft, we already publish [82% of our research Open Access](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/creating-your-publishing-strategy/open-access-publishing). The TU Delft Library has an [Open Publishing Platform](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/open-publishing) and offers an [Open Access Fund](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/open-access-funding) up to 2000 euros for open access publication fees.

### Open Data
**definition**

At Delft, responsibilities regarding Open Data are outlined in the [policies of the TU Delft and the Faculty](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/policies/tu-delft-faculty-policies/). 

There are several ways to receive support with your Open Data questions: 

- [Data Steward](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/support/data-stewardship/contact)
- [Data Champions](https://osc-delft.github.io/initiatives#data-champions)
- Data Managers ([Digital Competence Center](https://www.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=67120&L=1/))

There is also training available via the TU Delft Library ([Research Data Management 101](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/research-data-management-101) & [Open Science MOOC](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/mooc-open-science-sharing-your-research-with-the-world)) and a [Research Data Management Website](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management) with more information.
